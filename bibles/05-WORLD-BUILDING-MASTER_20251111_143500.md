## FACTIONS

### TRAUMA CORP (Medical Monopoly)

**Status:** Most powerful surviving faction in 2099  
**Alignment:** Neutral (profits from all sides)  
**Morality:** Morally gray - saves lives through medical slavery

---

#### ORIGINS (The Collapse - Week 1)

**Before The Collapse:**
- Mid-sized private medical corporation
- Operated premium hospitals for wealthy clients
- Independent payment systems (didn't rely on NEON INHERITANCE)
- Small but well-equipped facilities

**During Neon Collapse Day (2095.09.15):**
- Only medical provider still operational
- Payment systems still functional when everything else crashed
- Hospitals immediately overwhelmed with casualties

**Week 1 After Collapse:**
- Desperate people storming hospitals demanding treatment
- Families begging for help for blinded, burned loved ones
- Doctors refusing to work (couldn't get paid in crashed system)
- **Trauma Corp's Solution:** "Treatment for Indentured Servitude"
- "Your daughter needs surgery? Sign here. You're ours for 10 years."

**Became Most Powerful Faction Overnight:**
- Only working healthcare provider
- Seized abandoned hospitals by force
- Established medical monopoly within days
- Now controls medical care across city ruins

---

#### CURRENT OPERATIONS (2099)

**Medical Services:**
- **For Eddies:** Standard treatment if you can pay (expensive)
- **For Servitude:** Treatment in exchange for indentured labor contracts
- **Emergency Care:** Stabilization is free, further treatment costs
- **Contracts:** 5-20 years depending on severity of treatment needed
- **No Refunds:** Once you sign, you're property

**Contract Terms:**
- Work as Trauma Corp employee (security, nurses, janitors, runners)
- Cannot leave until contract expires
- Breaking contract = death penalty (enforced)
- Can be "sold" to other Trauma Corp facilities
- No pay - just basic food, shelter, continued medical care

**What They Control:**
- 80% of functioning hospitals in ruins
- Medical supply chains (drugs, equipment)
- Trained doctors and surgeons (some voluntary, most indentured)
- Ambulance services (extraction teams)
- Blood banks and organ storage

**Business Model:**
- Neutral - serve anyone who can pay or sign
- Don't care about politics, factions, wars
- "We save lives. The price is what it is."
- Profit from conflict (more injuries = more business)

---

#### MORALITY & REPUTATION

**Why Some See Them as Necessary:**
- Only reliable medical care available
- They DO save lives when no one else can
- Alternative is dying from treatable injuries
- Maintain medical standards (clean facilities, trained staff)
- "Better enslaved and alive than free and dead"

**Why Others See Them as Monsters:**
- Exploitation of desperate people
- Medical slavery is still slavery
- Families torn apart by contracts
- Charge extortionate prices for basic care
- Profit from human suffering
- "They're vultures feeding on tragedy"

**NPC Attitudes:**
- **Desperate:** "I have no choice. My kid is dying."
- **Grateful Servants:** "They saved my life. I owe them."
- **Bitter Servants:** "I've been here 8 years. Still 7 to go."
- **Enemies:** "Medical slavers. Burn them down."
- **Pragmatic:** "Don't love them, but I need them."

---

#### PLAYER INTERACTIONS

**Treatment Options:**
1. **Pay with Eddies:**
   - Expensive but no strings attached
   - 500-5000 eddies depending on injury
   - Only option for severe injuries ripper docs can't handle

2. **Sign Contract:**
   - Get treatment for free
   - Owe 5-20 years of service
   - Player becomes Trauma Corp employee temporarily
   - Must complete missions for them or break contract (hostile)

3. **Steal Medical Supplies:**
   - Raid Trauma Corp facilities
   - High risk - good security
   - Makes Trauma Corp hostile permanently
   - Useful for district medical needs

**Employment Paths:**
1. **Enforcer/Collector:**
   - Hunt down contract breakers
   - Collect debts from patients
   - Dark path - morally questionable
   - Pays very well (1000-3000 eddies per job)

2. **Extraction Specialist:**
   - Rescue wounded in dangerous zones
   - Bring them to Trauma Corp facilities
   - Neutral path - save lives, but for a price
   - Moderate pay (500-1500 eddies per extraction)

3. **Supply Runner:**
   - Transport medical supplies between facilities
   - Defend against raiders
   - Relatively moral path
   - Steady pay (300-800 eddies per run)

**Combat Interactions:**
- Attacking Trauma Corp = permanent hostility
- They WILL defend facilities with lethal force
- Well-armed security (ex-corpo guards)
- Consequences: Lose access to advanced medical care
- Your district may suffer from lack of treatment options

**Quest Involvement:**
- Trauma Corp offers side quests (morally gray)
- Main story: Neutral party (not aligned with Syndicate)
- Can provide information for price
- May help or hinder player depending on payment

---

#### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

**Trauma Corp Headquarters (Central District):**
- Former luxury hospital, now fortress
- Surrounded by armed guards
- Clean, well-lit - stark contrast to ruins
- NPCs: "It's like the Collapse never happened in there"

**Mobile Clinics (Various Districts):**
- Armored medical vans
- Basic treatment available
- Contract signing stations
- "Ambulance" extraction teams

**Indentured Barracks (Behind Hospitals):**
- Where contracted workers live
- Basic housing, adequate food
- Heavily monitored
- "Not prison, but not freedom either"

---

#### KEY NPCs (Placeholders for Character Bible)

**Dr. Eliza Reeves - Trauma Corp CEO:**
- Cold, pragmatic, business-focused
- "We save lives. The method is irrelevant."
- Not cruel, just ruthlessly practical

**Marcus "Doc" Sullivan - Indentured Surgeon:**
- Been contracted for 12 years (4 years remaining)
- Sympathetic to player
- Wants to help, but bound by contract

**Kira Nash - Head of Security:**
- Ex-Militech enforcer
- Protects facilities without mercy
- "Break the rules, break your face"

---

### THE SYNDICATE (Secret Shadow Government)

**Status:** Most organized and resourced faction (2099), operating in complete secrecy  
**Alignment:** Antagonist (from player perspective), believe they're saviors  
**Morality:** Authoritarian - "For humanity's own good"  
**Public Knowledge:** Rumors only - whispers of a shadow organization, no confirmed name or structure

---

#### ORIGINS (Pre-Collapse Preparation)

**Formation (2089 - Six Years Before Collapse):**
- Council of Five formed secret alliance with ORPHEUS AI
- Began preparing for "controlled collapse" scenario
- Goal: Dismantle mega-corps, save 60-70% of humanity through temporary authoritarian control
- Projected casualties: 30-40% (acceptable losses to prevent 95%+ extinction)

**Pre-Collapse Preparation (2089-2095):**
The Syndicate spent 6 years preparing for a post-collapse world:
- Secured luxury hotel as headquarters (reinforced, independent power, supplies)
- Stockpiled military-grade weapons, vehicles, medical equipment
- Recruited true believers from corpo executives, military, scientists
- Built state-of-the-art medical bay (almost Trauma Corp quality)
- Created food/water reserves for 1000+ people for 10+ years
- Established backup power systems, secure communications
- **They were the MOST prepared organization for collapse**

**The Miscalculation (2095):**
- Planned for 30-40% casualties (2.4-3.2 billion deaths)
- Reality: 90% casualties (7.2 billion deaths)
- Neon surge feedback loop no one predicted
- Infrastructure destruction far worse than models
- Phase 2 delayed indefinitely - need to rebuild capacity first

**Post-Collapse Adaptation (2095-2099):**
- Council went underground completely
- Shifted from "controlled transition" to "covert rebuilding"
- Realized they need critical mass before revealing themselves
- Target: ~1000 members before Phase 2 launch
- Current count: ~500 (halfway to unstoppable force)

---

#### ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

**Leadership - The Council of Five:**
1. **Dr. Raina Silva** - Mastermind, ORPHEUS liaison (secret Fifth member)
2. **Elena Vasquez** - Logistics coordinator, primary recruiter
3. **Dr. Sarah Chen** - Biotech specialist, medical operations
4. **Marcus "The Broker" Wolfe** - Arms dealer, resource acquisition
5. **James Blackwood** - Political strategist (conflicted, seeking redemption)

**ORPHEUS-PRIME (AI Partner):**
- Resides in luxury hotel server infrastructure
- Provides strategic calculations, surveillance coordination
- Controls automated defenses, security systems
- Council partnership (not control) - mutual cooperation

**Membership Tiers (~500 total):**

**Tier 1 - True Believers (~200 people):**
- Recruited through ideological conversion
- Know full Syndicate goals and structure
- **Can operate outside luxury hotel freely**
- Integrated into survivor settlements as sleeper agents
- Examples: Your friendly neighbor, helpful district technician, trusted trader

- **Inner Circle** (~20 people): Direct Council advisors, trusted with most sensitive operations
- **Field Commanders** (~30 people): Lead external operations, manage sleeper agent cells
- **Senior Agents** (~50 people): Veteran operatives, trusted with recruitment and assassination missions
- **Standard Agents** (~100 people): Embedded sleeper agents, intelligence gatherers, support roles
- **Privileges scale:** Inner Circle gets best quarters, direct Council access, highest trust

**Tier 2 - New Recruits (~150 people):**
- Recently recruited, still being indoctrinated
- Know some Syndicate goals, not full structure
- Limited external operations under supervision
- Training to become Tier 1 or military forces
- Mix of willing converts and those coerced through circumstances

**Sub-Ranks within Tier 2:**
- **Advanced Trainees** (~40 people): Proven loyalty, near promotion to Tier 1
- **Standard Recruits** (~70 people): Actively training, under evaluation
- **Probationary** (~40 people): New arrivals, heavily monitored, restricted movement
- **Privileges:** Advanced trainees get better rooms, more freedom, external mission opportunities

**Tier 3 - Captive Labor (~150 people):**
- **Confined to luxury hotel only - never allowed outside**
- Forced to join (join or die ultimatum)
- Perform support functions: cooking, cleaning, maintenance, manufacturing
- Guarded, monitored, no communication with outside
- Some hope for eventual "graduation" to Tier 2 if they prove loyalty
- Others are prisoners in all but name

**Sub-Ranks within Tier 3:**
- **Cooperatives** (~50 people): Show compliance, hope for promotion, get better treatment
- **Laborers** (~70 people): Standard workers, neutral compliance, basic privileges
- **Troublemakers** (~30 people): Resistant, watched closely, worst conditions, detention cell threats
- **Privileges:** Cooperatives get private rooms vs shared dorms, better food rations, lighter work

---

#### CURRENT OPERATIONS (2099)

**Primary Mission: Reach Critical Mass**
- Current: ~500 members
- Target: ~1000 members (unstoppable force)
- Then launch Phase 2: Forced integration of all survivors

**Recruitment Operations:**
- Council members (especially Vasquez) personally recruit high-value targets
- True believers approach survivors in settlements
- Pitch varies by target: Utopian vision, safety, order, purpose, belonging
- **Join or die** - non-recruits are eliminated (keeps organization secret)
- 48-hour ultimatum standard (creates pressure, prevents intelligence leaks)

**Intelligence Network:**
- ~200 sleeper agents embedded in survivor settlements
- Report back to Council on: settlement locations, leadership, resources, threats
- Identify recruitment targets (capable survivors, skilled workers)
- Monitor for investigation into Collapse conspiracy
- **Player's investigation flags them as high-priority target OR threat**

**Resource Management:**
- Luxury hotel HQ: Full power, climate control, security systems
- Vehicle fleet: 20+ heavily armored transports (military-grade)
- Weapons: Pre-Collapse military arsenal (assault rifles, smart weapons, combat bots)
- Medical: State-of-art bay, almost Trauma Corp quality, full pharmaceutical stock
- Food/Water: 10+ year reserves (prepared for controlled collapse)
- Manufacturing: Workshop for weapon maintenance, bot repairs, equipment fabrication

**Training Program:**
- All Tier 2/3 members receive professional military training
- Combat drills, tactical operations, weapon proficiency
- Indoctrination: Philosophy lectures, Council recordings, utopian vision presentations
- **Goal:** Every member capable as soldier when Phase 2 launches

---

#### SECRECY & OPERATIONAL SECURITY

**Why They Remain Hidden:**
- Can't reveal existence until they hit critical mass (~1000 members)
- Premature exposure = coordinated resistance destroys them
- Need element of surprise for Phase 2 forced integration
- Current 500 members not enough to control mega-city survivors

**Security Protocols:**
- **No confirmed name** - survivors call them "shadows," "the organization," "them"
- **No visual insignia** - no uniforms, patches, or identifying marks outside HQ
- **Cell structure** - sleeper agents don't know each other's identities
- **Communication blackout** - encrypted channels only, no external contact for captives
- **Elimination policy** - anyone who rejects recruitment is killed (can't risk intelligence leak)
- **Middle-men recruitment** - often send zealous Tier 1 believers, not Council members

**How They Stay Hidden:**
- Sleeper agents live normal lives in settlements
- External operations use unmarked vehicles, civilian clothes
- Luxury hotel exterior looks abandoned (camouflage, minimal external activity)
- Spread disinformation: "just rumors," "conspiracy theory," "survivors seeing patterns in chaos"

**Relationship with Other Factions:**

**Trauma Corp:**
- Knows Syndicate as "anonymous benefactor"
- Syndicate occasionally contracts medical services (pay premium, no questions)
- Trauma Corp doesn't know who they are - just wealthy mystery client
- No formal alliance, purely transactional

**Nomad Clans:**
- Unaware Syndicate exists (too far from cities to hear whispers)
- Syndicate avoids nomads (low-value recruitment targets, hard to control)

**Netrunners:**
- Cipher SUSPECTS something organized orchestrated Collapse
- Doesn't know name, structure, or that Council exists
- Has evidence of coordination but no smoking gun
- Syndicate monitors netrunner investigations closely

**Anarchists (Spark's Cell):**
- Heard whispers of "shadow government" rebuilding
- Assumes it's corpo remnants, not dedicated organization
- Would be Syndicate's enemies if they knew truth

**Independent Settlements:**
- Some survivors report "friendly neighbor who vanished overnight"
- Rumors of "recruiters who make offers you can't refuse"
- Most dismiss as paranoia or survivor trauma

---

#### LUXURY HOTEL HEADQUARTERS

**Location:** Former 5-star hotel, pre-Collapse luxury destination  
**Status:** Only fully operational large building besides Trauma Corp facilities

**External Appearance:**
- Looks abandoned from street level (intentional camouflage)
- Broken windows (cosmetic), damaged facade, overgrown entrance
- No visible lights at night (blackout curtains, light discipline)
- Scavengers avoid it (Syndicate spreads rumors of radiation/structural instability)
- **Main entrance appears sealed/unusable**

**Secret Entrance System:**
- **No permanent public entrances** - all access through hidden tunnels
- Tunnel locations rotate every 2-4 weeks (operational security)
- Entrances hidden in: Collapsed buildings, sewer access points, subway tunnels, ruined basements
- Once tunnel location discovered or compromised: Destroyed, sealed, new one excavated elsewhere
- Only Tier 1+ know current tunnel locations (Tier 3 captives never learn them)
- ORPHEUS-PRIME tracks all tunnel usage (biometric scans at entry)
- Multiple tunnels active simultaneously (redundancy, escape routes)
- Construction crews (Tier 3 labor) dig new tunnels constantly
- **If player discovers active tunnel:** Syndicate abandons it within 24 hours, eliminates witnesses

**Internal Reality:**
- **Fully powered** - backup generators + restored grid connection
- Climate controlled (heating/cooling functional)
- Clean water, working plumbing
- Elevators operational
- Security systems: Cameras, automated turrets, combat bots
- Living quarters for 500+ members (comfortable, pre-Collapse luxury)

**Key Facilities:**

**Penthouse (Council Level):**
- Living quarters for Council of Five
- War room (strategy, planning, Phase 2 coordination)
- ORPHEUS-PRIME server core
- Luxury preserved: Working showers, comfortable beds, pre-Collapse amenities

**Upper Floors (True Believers):**
- Comfortable rooms for Tier 1 members
- Training facilities (combat gym, firing range)
- Recreation areas (maintain morale)
- Briefing rooms for external operations

**Mid Floors (New Recruits):**
- Barracks-style housing for Tier 2
- Classroom for indoctrination lectures
- Training areas
- Monitored more closely than Tier 1

**Lower Floors (Captive Labor):**
- Guarded dormitories for Tier 3
- Workshop/manufacturing (weapon maintenance, bot repairs)
- Kitchen/laundry/maintenance stations
- Medical bay (state-of-art, almost Trauma Corp level)
- **Tier 3 never allowed above these floors**

**Basement Levels:**
- Vehicle garage (20+ armored transports)
- Armory (military-grade weapons, ammunition, explosives)
- Food/water storage (massive reserves)
- Power generators (backup systems)
- Server room (ORPHEUS-PRIME core infrastructure)
- Detention cells (for "difficult" recruits being "convinced")

**Security:**
- Armed guards at all entry points
- Combat bots patrol key areas
- Biometric access controls (captives can't reach upper floors or exits)
- ORPHEUS-PRIME monitors all internal cameras
- External perimeter: Hidden cameras, motion sensors
- Quick response team for breach attempts

---

#### MILITARY CAPABILITY

**Personnel Strength:**
- ~300 combat-capable members (Tier 1 + Tier 2 trained fighters)
- Professional military training (ex-corpo security, former soldiers)
- Disciplined, coordinated, experienced leadership

**Equipment:**

**Weapons (Military-Grade, Pre-Collapse Stock):**
- Assault rifles (smart-targeting, armor-piercing rounds)
- Submachine guns (close quarters)
- Sniper rifles (long-range elimination)
- Combat shotguns (breaching, crowd control)
- Smart pistols (officer sidearms)
- Grenades (frag, EMP, flashbang)
- Rocket launchers (anti-vehicle, reserved for emergencies)

**Combat Bots:**
- 30+ security bots (autonomous patrol, guard duty)
- 10+ assault bots (heavy combat, raid support)
- ORPHEUS-PRIME controlled (coordinated tactics, no friendly fire)

**Vehicles:**
- 20+ armored transports (troop deployment, cargo hauling)
- Military-grade armor plating (resistant to small arms)
- Mounted weapons (some vehicles have turrets)
- EMP-hardened systems
- Fuel reserves for extended operations

**Tactical Advantages:**
- Element of surprise (no one knows they exist at scale)
- Superior equipment vs most survivor factions
- Coordinated AI support (ORPHEUS-PRIME tactical analysis)
- Well-fed, well-rested, motivated troops
- Secure base of operations

**Tactical Limitations:**
- Only 500 members (can't hold territory long-term yet)
- Revealing forces prematurely risks entire operation
- Vehicles/weapons irreplaceable if lost (limited manufacturing)
- Dependent on luxury hotel HQ (losing it cripples operations)
- Internal dissent possible (some Tier 3 captives, Blackwood's doubts)
- **Could be stopped by united opposition:** If Trauma Corp + Nomads + Netrunners + Anarchists + Player's District allied against them, Syndicate would be overwhelmed
- **Secrecy is their greatest weapon:** Once exposed before critical mass, they lose strategic advantage

---

#### RECRUITMENT TACTICS

**Target Identification:**
- Sleeper agents identify: capable survivors, skilled workers, natural leaders
- Council prioritizes: technicians, soldiers, medics, strategists
- Avoid: Those too independent, ideologically opposed, or investigation-prone
- **Exception:** High-value targets (like player) worth the risk

**The Pitch (Varies by Target):**

**For Idealists:**
- "We're building a better world from the ashes"
- "No more corporate greed, no more suffering"
- "Join us in creating true order and safety"
- Elena Vasquez specializes in this approach

**For Pragmatists:**
- "Survivors are dying in chaos - we have resources, power, security"
- "Join the winning side before it's too late"
- "Phase 2 is inevitable - be part of solution, not problem"
- Marcus Wolfe's specialty

**For the Desperate:**
- "We have food, medicine, safety - your family will never starve"
- "You're barely surviving - we're thriving"
- "One decision ends your suffering forever"

**For High-Value Targets (Like Player):**
- Personal recruitment by Council member (usually Vasquez)
- Luxury treatment (dinner in penthouse, shown amenities)
- Appeal to ambition ("You're building something - imagine what we could build together")
- Romance/seduction if applicable (Vasquez specialty)

**The Ultimatum:**
- 48 hours to decide (standard pressure tactic)
- Join: Welcomed, indoctrinated, assigned tier based on trust/skills
- Refuse: Eliminated (can't risk intelligence leak, maintains secrecy)
- **No third option** - "You're with us or you're a threat"

**Post-Recruitment:**

**Tier 1 Track (True Believers):**
- Full indoctrination program (2-4 weeks)
- Phase 2 education (goals, philosophy, Council vision)
- External operations training
- Eventually becomes sleeper agent or internal operator

**Tier 2/3 Track (New/Forced Recruits):**
- Military training (2-4 weeks)
- Limited indoctrination (need-to-know basis)
- Tier 2: Supervised external missions
- Tier 3: Hotel-only work, heavy monitoring

---

#### PHASE 2 GOALS (When Critical Mass Reached)

**The Plan:**
Once Syndicate reaches ~1000 members (double current strength):

**Step 1 - Reveal:**
- Simultaneous broadcasts across all survivor settlements
- Council announces existence, shows resources, presents "choice"
- "Join our structured society or remain in dying chaos"

**Step 2 - Integration:**
- Settlements given 72-hour ultimatum to join
- Compliant settlements absorbed peacefully (become Syndicate districts)
- Resistant settlements: Military force, leadership elimination

**Step 3 - Mandatory Systems:**
- All citizens receive tracking implants ("for safety and resource distribution")
- AI-monitored cyberware integration (ORPHEUS oversight)
- Centralized resource distribution (food, water, medicine rationed)
- Work assignments (skills-based labor allocation)

**Step 4 - New Order:**
- Council governs from luxury hotel (central authority)
- ORPHEUS-PRIME manages logistics, surveillance, enforcement
- "Utopian" society: No poverty, no starvation, no chaos
- Cost: Complete loss of freedom, autonomy, privacy

**Player's Role:**
- Investigation threatens to expose Syndicate before critical mass
- Player can stop Phase 2 by: destroying Council, turning public against them, or allying with them
- Multiple ending paths depending on player choices

---

#### PLAYER INTERACTIONS

**Quest 06: First Contact (Vasquez Recruitment):**
- Player meets Elena Vasquez at luxury hotel
- Offered recruitment (join or 48-hour countdown begins)
- Can accept, refuse, or manipulate (high Empathy/Intelligence)

**Syndicate Path (If Player Joins):**
- Become Tier 1 member, eventually Council advisor
- Romance option with Vasquez (if male player)
- Participate in recruitment operations
- Help reach critical mass for Phase 2
- Ending: New authoritarian order (player as enforcer or leader)

**Opposition Path (If Player Refuses):**
- Syndicate becomes primary antagonist
- Hunted by sleeper agents and strike teams
- Must expose them to survivor factions
- Build coalition to stop Phase 2
- Ending: Defeat Council, preserve independence

**Manipulation Path (High Skills):**
- Pretend to join, gather intelligence
- Sabotage from within
- Turn Blackwood against Council (he's already conflicted)
- Exploit internal tensions
- Ending: Syndicate collapses from within

---

#### NOTABLE NPCS

**See Character Bible for full profiles:**
- Council of Five (Raina, Vasquez, Chen, Marcus, Blackwood)
- ORPHEUS-PRIME (AI partner)
- Syndicate Agents (procedurally generated sleeper agents in settlements)

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING: THE NEON LIGHTS

**Visual Design Philosophy:**  
The neon lights aren't decorative - they're a constant reminder of The Collapse. The game's title comes to life through environmental storytelling.

---

### VISUAL GUIDELINES FOR ARTISTS

**Dead Neon (90% of signs in game):**
- Burned-out neon signs everywhere
- Dark, twisted metal frames with no light
- Blast marks scorched onto walls where signs exploded
- Shattered glass covering streets (audio: crunching underfoot)
- Empty sign mounts with charred, melted wiring dangling
- Graffiti warnings: "DON'T LOOK AT THE NEON" painted over dead signs
- Rust and weathering from 4 years of neglect

**Visual Details:**
- Metal frames bent and warped from heat
- Glass tubes cracked, blackened from power surge
- Some signs partially collapsed, hanging at angles
- Neon gas residue visible in intact tubes (no glow)
- Oxidation patterns showing age

---

### DANGEROUS NEON (Environmental Hazard - Rare)

**Active Flickering Signs (5% of neon in game):**
- A few signs still receiving unstable power
- Flicker weakly, erratically - strobing effect
- Dangerous to look at directly
- NPCs always avert their eyes from these
- Warning signs nearby: "LIVE NEON - DO NOT LOOK"

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- If player stares directly at flickering neon: temporary blindness debuff
- Screen whites out for 5-10 seconds
- Audio: high-pitched buzzing, electrical hum
- NPCs will warn player: "Don't look at that one directly, choom"

**Quest Possibilities:**
- Side quest: Disable dangerous neon signs in district
- Help protect residents from active hazards
- Requires technical knowledge to safely shut down
- Rewards: District morale increase, safety improvement

---

### NEON VICTIMS (NPC Design)

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Blinded survivors wearing makeshift eye protection
- Dark goggles, cloth wraps, welding masks
- Burn scars on faces (especially around eyes)
- Older NPCs more likely to have scars (were adults during Collapse)
- Some NPCs using white canes or guide dogs
- Distinctive "look away" behavior when near any neon

**NPC Dialogue Examples:**
- "I was looking up when it happened. Haven't seen right since."
- "My kid thought the lights were pretty. Now she's blind."
- "We call it Neon Collapse. The day the city burned from the inside."
- "Four years later, I still flinch when I see light."
- "That neon took my eyes. Took my daughter. Took everything."

**Cultural Impact:**
- Children born post-Collapse taught to NEVER look at neon
- Cultural superstition around neon lights (cursed, evil)
- Some NPCs want ALL neon destroyed (trauma response)
- Others want to preserve dead neon as memorial

---

### CRAFTING & GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS

**Neon Glass Shards (Crafting Material):**
- Collectible resource found near destroyed signs
- Used for crafting weapons (sharp edges)
- Used for crafting tools and trade goods
- Valuable commodity in survivor economy
- NPC dialogue: "Neon glass - sharp, pretty, and cursed"

**Item Description:**
*"Fragments of shattered neon tubes. The same light that blinded thousands now serves a new purpose. Some say the glass is cursed. Others say it's just glass. Either way, it cuts clean."*

**Uses:**
- Craft improvised blades (neon glass knife)
- Reinforce armor with sharp edges
- Trade to merchants (moderate value)
- Quest items (some NPCs collect it for memorials)

---

### MEMORIAL IMAGERY

**Neon Sign Memorials:**
- Some burned neon signs intentionally preserved
- Kept as memorials to lost businesses, lost people
- Flowers, candles, photos placed beneath dead signs
- "This was Jinx's Diner. Good people. All gone now."
- Environmental storytelling without explicit text

**Visual Design:**
- Weathered photos pinned to sign frames
- Graffiti names of the dead
- Small shrines built around particularly iconic signs
- Shows community remembering before the Collapse

---

### COLOR PALETTE DESIGN

**Pre-Collapse (Flashbacks/Holograms):**
- Vibrant neon pinks, electric blues, acid greens
- Saturated colors, high contrast
- "Blade Runner" aesthetic - neon everywhere
- City alive with light

**Post-Collapse (Current Game):**
- Muted, desaturated colors
- Dark shadows, minimal light sources
- Dead neon = dark metal against gray concrete
- Neon colors ONLY visible as:
  - Reflections in puddles (showing what was)
  - Rare flickering signs (dangerous)
  - Holographic displays (pre-Collapse footage)

**Visual Contrast:**
- Shows player what was lost
- Flashbacks burst with color
- Present day is gray, dark, oppressive
- Neon Collapse = the death of color and light

---

### AUDIO DESIGN (For Sound Designers)

**Dead Neon:**
- Silence (eerie absence of electrical hum)
- Wind whistling through empty sign frames
- Glass crunching underfoot

**Dangerous Neon:**
- High-pitched electrical whine
- Irregular buzzing (unstable power)
- Crackling, popping sounds
- Makes players uncomfortable (intentional)

**Neon Collapse Flashback Audio:**
- Rising electrical hum
- Sudden SURGE sound
- Glass shattering
- Screaming
- Then silence

---

### NARRATIVE PURPOSE

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Title Integration:** "Neon Collapse" becomes visceral, not just a name
2. **Constant Reminder:** World never lets player forget what happened
3. **Show Don't Tell:** Players understand Collapse through observation
4. **Unique Identity:** No other cyberpunk game has "killer neon lights"
5. **Environmental Horror:** Beauty became weapon
6. **Lived-In World:** 4 years of survivors adapting to trauma
