# Optional AI/ML dependencies for NeonWorks
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-ai.txt
#
# These packages are LARGE (~4GB) and only needed for AI-powered features:
# - Image generation (Stable Diffusion via diffusers)
# - Text generation (LLMs via transformers)
# - AI-assisted asset creation

# PyTorch - Deep learning framework
torch>=2.0.0

# Diffusers - Stable Diffusion image generation
diffusers>=0.25.0

# Transformers - LLM text generation (optional)
# transformers>=4.30.0

# Accelerate - Faster model loading (optional)
# accelerate>=0.20.0

# Note: These packages are NOT required for core engine functionality.
# The engine will work fine without them - you just won't have AI features.
