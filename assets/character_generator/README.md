# Character Generator Assets

This directory contains procedurally generated placeholder sprites for the
character generator system.

## Directory Structure

- `bodies/` - Base character bodies (male, female)
- `hair/` - Hair styles (short, long, mohawk, bun)
- `clothing/` - Clothing items (tunic, robe, armor)
- `weapons/` - Weapons (sword, staff, bow, dagger)
- `faces/` - Facial features (human, elf, orc)
- `masks/` - Grayscale masks for color customization

## Usage

These are placeholder assets. Replace them with your own art while maintaining:
- 64x64 pixel size
- PNG format with transparency
- Matching masks in `masks/` subdirectories

## Color Customization

Masks are grayscale images where white pixels (255) are recolored and black
pixels (0) are left unchanged. This allows flexible color customization while
preserving details.
